Required Skills/Experience       Experience using WordPress     Good English skills     Ability to solve problems with minimal direction, supervision      2.   Preferred Additional Skills/Experience       Experience using Beaver Builder     WPML - Website Translator     Access to Photoshop or GIMP for the opening of design files     Beaver Builder Themer     Ability to solve problems with minimal direction, supervision     High degree of learning agility / fast and interested learner     Self-motivated, self-starter     Uses time efficiently     Patient, positive and supportive attitude with team members     Experience with WordPress installations, configuration, security, and theme development      3.   Initial Responsibilities       Testing a series of custom features in a site     Building modules     Translation management      4.   Target Responsibilities       Custom WordPress site builds – take a Photoshop file and apply the styles to a WordPress child theme, work with Beaver Builder, PHP, and WordPress child theme templates to set up custom features and layouts as needed.     Modify and create new Beaver Builder modules to add support for features, complex functionality, and intricate styling that aren’t natively available.     Develop and maintain custom themes with an eye towards automation and end user-friendliness     Extend 3rd party plugins with WordPress hooks, template overrides, or creative solutions to accomplish time-sensitive tasks     Plugin troubleshooting/problem-solving.

Examples of tasks:    Marketing needs to make customisations to their events in Beaver Builder to display an external link that they can change from the WordPress admin. You would add a custom field that shows on posts with something like Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) and then modify the Beaver Builder post feed module to display data from the ACF field on the frontend.    A website with hundreds of already created posts and pages is being redesigned. You would create page templates and widgets that account for dynamic content in order to restyle existing posts in a way that ensures nothing slips through the cracks while working within the confines of the already existing website or proactively identifying new technology that would better serve the redesign and decrease redesign time.    A designer you’re working with has finished their mock-up on a new site build with great UI/UX, but is unsure how to handle dynamic content within their design. You proactively suggest solutions and utilize responsive frontend best practices to ensure the website looks good on every browser and every device regardless of what the content looks like.
